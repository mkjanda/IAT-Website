    <p>The software was not designed for standalone test administration but if you wish, you may
        keep your own site's domain in the address bar during test administration or host a test within an iframe.
        You'll need to register your site in my CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) database and then
        setup forward proxies on your server. The registration process is straight-forward enough. Simply fill out
        <span class='hilightHover' data-bind='event : { click : () => { navigate("page", "section-cors"); } }'>this form</span>
        under &quot;Commercial Uses&quot; on the homepage.</p>

        	<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The configuration to the left tests for matching URI patterns to forward as well as ensuring
        	that your server's name is available as a request header so that your CORS registration can be 
        	verified. Requests at the URL path /my-iat will be forwarded to <span class="hilight">iatsoftware.net</span> with
            	 an IAT name of &quot;MyIAT,&quot; for a client with the ID of 100. Additionally, any
            	 elements such as tokens in the query string to /my-iat will be preserved.</p></div>
         <p>Turning so many SSL options to &quot;off&quot; might raise a red flag in your mind. The 
         reason for this is the first line, which ensures that your host name will appear as an HTTP
         request header when it arrives at <span class="hilight">iatsoftware.net</span>. An effect
         of this is that your host will try to perform SSL authentication on itself using the credentials
         at <span class="hilight">iatsoftware.net</span>. It is receiving the same certificate that
         a browser does during a direct connection, so if the test-taker's connection to your server
         is secure, there's no cause for alarm.</p>
         <p>I regret that I simply do not have time to mock up configurations for other popular web hosting
         software, but at the time of this writing, no interest has been shown in this feature. I am
         including it because I feel it is inevitable that I will.</p>
