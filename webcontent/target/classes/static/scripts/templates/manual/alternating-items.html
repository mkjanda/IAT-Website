<p>In a traditional 7-Block IAT, blocks three and four are
	transposed with blocks six and seven on alternate administrations to
	balance the test. Because of this, if instruction blocks precede block
	three and block six, it is desirable to have these instruction blocks
	be transposed on alternate administrations as well. Perhaps, as well,
	you have a survey or set of surveys that you with to alternate. This is
	accomplished via the following window.</p>

				To the left, you see two different tabs of the window wherein
				alternating items are specified. In the first are shown instruction
				blocks. To set two blocks of instructions to be transposed in order
				on alternate administrations, click the check box next to each
				instruction block and then click the <span class="hilight">Alternate
					Items</span> button. Only two instruction blocks may be assigned to an
				alternation group, though multiple pairs of instruction blocks may
				be set to alternate, in which event each set of paired instruction
				blocks will be transposed in order on alternate administrations.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">In the screen shot on the bottom,
				you see a list of surveys. Unlike instruction blocks, you may assign
				more than two surveys to be transposed with one another on alternate
				administrations of the IAT. In the event that more than two surveys
				are assigned to an alternation group, the surveys will be rotated in
				order, meaning that on the first alternation, the last survey will
				be administered first, followed by the first survey, and so on,
				until the next-to-last survey in the alternation group is displayed.
				The original placements of the surveys mark the positions the
				surveys in the alternation group will be rotated into. For example,
				if a non-alternated survey is originally administered as the second
				survey, it will always be administered as the second survey with the
				alternating surveys rotating about it. Also, it is possible to mark
				a single survey as alternating. This will cause it to appear before
				and after the IAT on alternate administrations. By default, singular
				surveys set to alternate will be post- pended to the list of surveys
				at the opposite end of the IAT from the original placement of the
				survey. This can be changed so that the &quot;self-alternating&quot;
				survey is prepended to the list of surveys at the alternate end of
				the IAT from the original placement of that survey.</p>
