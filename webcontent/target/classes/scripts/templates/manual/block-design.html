    <p>A standard IAT consists of seven blocks. Of these seven blocks, only four are used in scoring. Blocks one and two consist of the initial presentation 
        of the stimuli from each category to the user. Block five repeats the group of stimuli in block two, transposing the two response key values in the 
        upper-left and upper-right corners of the test window. In blocks three, four, six, and seven, the stimuli from both categories are intermixed. 
        Blocks three and four contain different pairings of the response keys from blocks one and two than do blocks six and seven. It is through these 
        two different pairings of the response keys that it is possible to determine bias.</p>

            <p>This is the IAT Block design form. You may add stimuli by clicking the Add Stimulus button and then selecting the type of the stimulus. 
                If you choose a text stimulus, enter the text for your stimulus and choose the font, size, and color. For image stimuli, click the 
                Browse button to select an image file from your computer. Alternatively, click the select button to re-use an image employed elsewhere 
                in the IAT.</p>
            <p>Near the bottom right, you may enter a brief set of instructions that will appear along with each stimulus during the test.</p>
            <p>You can scroll through the stimuli you have defined along the bar at the bottom, dragging and dropping them to reorder them if you wish, 
                or left-clicking one to select it for editing or deletion.</p>

    <p>Once you have finished adding stimuli to your IAT block and keying them, click the Done button to return to the main form. It is usually 
        only necessary to create the first two blocks of your IAT and then click the Generate 7-Block IAT button in the main window to generate 
        the remaining five.</p>
    <p>When you upload your IAT, you will be asked how many stimuli you with to present to the test taker in each block. The standard values are 
        10 stimuli in blocks one, two, three, five, and six and 20 stimuli in blocks four and seven. Again, you may specify any values you wish 
        but it is these values which have been proven to produce the most meaningful results. The stimuli that are presented are chosen randomly 
        from the pool of the stimuli for each block, as if the stimuli for each block were tossed into a hat and one stimulus was removed at a 
        time, presented to the test-taker, and then tossed back in the hat.</p>
