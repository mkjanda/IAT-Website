        <p>The Implicit Association Test (IAT) offers two important tools. One is that it offers a test 
            administrator the capacity to measure attitudes and biases that a subject is not willing to admit. Perhaps more 
            interesting is the second tool. The IAT offers the test administrator the ability to measure attitudes and biases 
            of which the test taker might not be aware.</p>
        <p>Beyond determining whether John or Mary is a pedophile or a bigot, it can be used to measure thought processes on an
            unconscious level. It can determine how people think or feel about things in an intuitive way that doesn't involve rational thought. These
            invisible thought processes have been shown to predict or account for phenomena in ways that other measurements cannot.</p>
        <p>So how does it work? The concept is simple when grasped but not the easiest to explain. An IAT measures bias between
            pairings of words or images. For instance, suppose you wanted to find out if John is a bigot. You might try to determine
            whether he associates the word <span class="hilight">Black</span> with the word <span class="hilight">Good</span>
            or the word <span class="hilight">Bad</span>.</p>

        <p>Here you see a broken heart that is to be placed in the category in the upper-right corner as "Bad." This is
            the cornerstone of IAT design, to devise two concepts such as "black" and "white" and then two words that lie at polar
            opposite ends of the same continuum. This way, you are able to determine which end of the continuum the subject associates
            each concept with.</p>

    <svg-header params="caption : 'The 7-block design', template : subHeaderTemplate, display : display"></svg-header>
    <div>
        <p>Each IAT is divided into seven blocks. The first two blocks supply a response key that contains only the
            concept words or only the continuum words. For instance, the first block might have the response value <span class="hilight">Black</span> in the
            upper-left corner and <span class="hilight">White</span> in the upper-right corner. The subject would be shown faces of black and white people and
            asked to categorize them by pressing keys on their keyboard. Then the second block would have <span class="hilight">Good</span> in the upper-left corner
            and <span class="hilight">Bad</span> in the upper-right corner. For this block, the subject would see stimuli &ndash; words or images &ndash; that are categorically
            good or bad.</p>
        <p>Blocks three and four appear identical to the test taker and are only regarded as separate for the purpose of
            scoring the test. In these blocks, the two response keys from blocks one and two are combined to form the response keys
            you saw on the previous screen. During these blocks, the subject would be shown pictures of white and black people as well
            as stimuli that are categorically good or bad. The idea is that if the subject associates <span class="hilight">Good</span> with 
            <span class="hilight">Black</span>, he will	provide correct responses faster for those stimuli.</p>
        <p>Block five is largely a rehash of block two, with the response keys transposed from left to right. Blocks
            six and seven consist of the combined response keys as did blocks three and four, however the pairings are reversed, so
            <span class="hilight">Black</span> would appear with <span class="hilight">Bad</span> and <span class="hilight">White</span> 
            would appear with <span class="hilight">Good</span>. This provides a counter-point to the measurements
            made in blocks three and four.</p>
