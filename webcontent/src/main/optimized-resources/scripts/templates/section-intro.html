	<p>Why does this site exist? Because I've developed software that allows people to design IATs with a point
	and click interface and administer them on the Internet. If you're curious about the IAT and what you might
	be able to do with it, click the Contact button above to submit any inquiries. I'm happy to address them.
	If you're already familiar with the test, let me show you what the software can do.</p>
