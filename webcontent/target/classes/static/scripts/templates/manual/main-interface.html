<p>This is the form you will see when you first start the program.
	The main form is used to manage the components of your IAT, including
	adding and deleting surveys and blocks of stimuli and instruction
	screens. The main form also provides accessibility to the Server
	Interface which allows you to upload an IAT or to manage the IATs you
	currently have deployed on the server, performing tasks such as
	uploading and deleting IATs and retrieving test data. You can also
	specify which blocks of your IAT are transposed on alternate
	administrations by clicking the Specify Alternating Items button.
	Clicking the Generate 7-Block IAT button will open a form that will
	allow you specify two IAT blocks you have created manually that the
	program will use to generate a 7-Block IAT.</p>

		<p>The buttons along the left side of the form allow you to add
			components to your IAT. Each component appears in the contents pane
			on the left side. You can expand or collapse these components by
			clicking on them. Clicking on a component or sub-component will
			select it and preview it in the pane on the right. There, more
			options will become available, such as editing, deleting, and moving
			the component.</p>
		<p>Components that appear in a color other than blue are set to
			alternate with other components of the same color.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the form is a panel for error messages. If you
	do not completely define an element of your IAT, you will be unable to
	package it and an error message will appear here. Click on the error
	message to navigate to the source of the error and correct it.</p>
