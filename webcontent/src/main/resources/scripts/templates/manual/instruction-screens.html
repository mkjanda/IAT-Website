<p>Blocks of instruction screens can be inserted into the IAT. These instruction screens can appear before or after any
    block of stimuli.
    Instruction screen blocks can be set to alternate with the blocks of the IAT (in a traditional 7-block IAT, blocks
    #3 and #4 are
    transposed with blocks #6 and #7 on alternate administrations.) Instruction screens fall into three categories:
    <span class="hilight">Text Instruction Screens</span>, <span class="hilight">Key Instruction Screens</span>, and
    <span class="hilight">Mock Item Instruction Screens</span>.

        <p>The buttons in the lower right corner of the form can be used to add, insert, and delete Instruction Screens.
            Inserting an
            instruction screen will cause it to appear in the position of the currently selected screen while adding an
            instruction
            screen will append it to the end of the instruction block. Use the selection buttons at the top of the form
            to select the
            type of instruction Screen and the text edit near the bottom right, above the preview bar, to select the key
            the user must
            press to proceed to the next instruction screen and to edit the message that appears at the bottom of the

<p>Along the bottom of the screen, you will see previews of all the instruction screens you design. You can scroll
    through these previews
    by clicking on the left and right arrow buttons at either side of the preview strip. You can also drag and drop
    these previews to reorder
    them. Blocks of instructions typically appear before blocks one, two, three, five, and six. To force the instruction
    blocks that appear
    before blocks three and six to be transposed on alternate administrations along with the subsequent two IAT blocks,
    click the <span class="hilight">Specify
        Alternating Items</span> button on the main form.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to include at least one keyed instruction screen before each change in response keys that occurs in
    the program. So, before
    blocks one, two, three, five, and six, you will want to have a Keyed Instruction Screen informing the test taker
    what is expected of him or
    her during the next portion of the test. As blocks three and four are transposed with blocks six and seven of the
    IAT on alternate
    administrations to balance the test, you will need to manually set up the keyed instruction screens that precede
    those blocks to alternate
    on alternate administrations as well.</p>
