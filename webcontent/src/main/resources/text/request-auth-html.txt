            <h1>Redirect Complete</h1>
            <div class="authContent">
                <p>client_id:</p>
                <p>CLIENT611:straight-drag:16269d02f38b4e3a</p>

            <p>
                Please note that you should <span class="hilight">NEVER</span> embed your client secret into a webpage or even a mobile app. Practice is to issue client secrets that begin with &quot;secret:&quot; to discourage such behavior. It is embedded
                here for simplicity's sake.
            </p>
            <p>
                The &quot;code&quot; and &quot;state&quot; parameters are retrieved from the query string, not from the respose body. Again, when the GET request was issued, the server responded with a redirect (302) which has no response body. Instead, it sends you
                to the pre-agreed upon URL with the query parameters shown. Let us suppose that the state token that was issued in the GET request makes reference to some key on this server that the test, test password, and test-taker token can be gotten
                with. Additionally, this value could perhaps be used to retrieve the client id and client secret. The &quot;code&quot; parameters will be supplied in the next step to complete authentication.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next step is to issue a POST request back to
                <span style="color: #c01352">https://iatsoftware.net/IAT/OAuth/RequestAuth
                </span> that contains the client id, client secret, authentication code, and a &quot;grant_type&quot; parameter that must be set equal to &quot;code&quot;. You may pack the four values into a query string and submit a POST,
                you may send a JSON object via AJAX, you may send a FormData object via AJAX. Sending them as request headers is impermissable because request headers are not encrypted. Look at the example code to the right for options.
