    <p>Your download should begin automatically. If it does not, click <span class="hilightHover" data-bind="event : { click : download }">here</span>.
        If you encounter any problems with the software, please do not hesitate to contact me at <span class="hilight">michael@iatsoftware.net</span>.
        Contact me as well with suggestions or feature requests. I'm presently working on employing deep learning, a form of AI, to conduct item
        analysis, so if you'd like to contribute your data, I'd be happy to have it. If you did not read the privacy section, it is impossible
        to access your data without the password you choose when you upload your test, which is not stored on the server. If you would like
        an in-depth description of how this works, click <span class="hilightHover" data-bind="click : goToPrivacy">here</span>.

    <p>Do not close this window yet. Your product key is:</p>
    <div><svg-header params="caption: state().productKey, display : display, template : productKeyTemplate, id : 'product-key-text'"></svg-header></div>
    <div><input type="button" value="Copy to Clipboard" id="copy-product-key-button" data-bind="click : copyProductKey" /></div>
    <p>You will need it to activate the program. A manual is included in your download. You may also find online documentation on the menu bar above.
        Both contain a step-by-step example of creating a test.</p>
        <p>If you have trouble with product activation, email me at <span class="highlight">michael@iatsoftware.net</span>
        and I will email you a dummy activation file once I have an email address on record.</p>
    <!-- /ko -->        
    <!-- ko if: state().action === 'organization-download' -->
    <p>Your product key is the same as every other user in your organization. When you activate the software, a user account will be created
        on the server for you. If you are activating the product on a second machine, make sure you supply the same email address when activating the software
        or any tests you might have already uploaded will be inaccessible. If you no longer have access to that email address, as a last resort, get in 
        touch with the principle contact for your organization, <span data-bind='text: state().firstName'></span> <span data-bind='text: state().lastName'></span>.
        With his or her consent, I will alter your existing user profile.</p>

            <p>You might see this box when you first run the program. This is because the software is freshly signed
                and does not have &quot;reputation&quot; with Windows SmartScreen. If contacting me would reassure you
                that the software is save, please do.</p>
