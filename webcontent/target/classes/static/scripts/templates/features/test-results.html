<p>Test results are kept on the server indefinitely. Absolutely every effort will be made to ensure
that future versions of the software are capable of retrieving data collected with older versions of
the software. If this is not possible, a utility program will be made available to allow you to
download your data.</p>
<p>As of now, it is only possible to export data to Excel files. You may browse the results from
within the program, though I admit this is of little use. The Excel workbooks generated by the software
consists of upwards of 150 spreadsheets and can take quite a bit of time to generate, so feel free to 
take the opportunity to fetch a cup of coffee while the program works, or make lunch in the case of
larger data sets. For most users, only the first three pages of the Excel workbook will be of interest. 
The others contain data intended for those brave enough to attempt item analysis.</p>
<p>There are no current plans to allow for export to SPSS files.</p>
