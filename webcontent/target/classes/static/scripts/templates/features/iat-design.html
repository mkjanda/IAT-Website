<p>Good IAT design hinges on choosing stimuli well. Research has indicated that, even if a person does not
know how to classify a stimuli the first time, they will learn through the course of the test, and often these
stimuli are among the better ones. It's important to make good use of response keys too. For an example of
this, click on the <span class="buttonReference">Sample Tests</span> label above and select the <span class="buttonReference">Marketing</span>
IAT. It's intended to test package preference.</p>

<p>As you can see, rather than stimuli consisting of words interspersed with pictures of the products, I chose
to use pictures of the products in the response key. Information on how to do this can be found by clicking
on <span class="buttonReference">Response Keys</span> in the menu bar to the left. Also note that that the stimulus is a bit ambiguous.
Jealousy is often associated with desire, but here it is keyed with the green bottle. Part of the rationale is
that people feel distaste at the jealousy of others. Another part of the rationale is that I used different
fonts for stimuli associated with the soap bottles than I did for stimuli associated with the words &quot;desire&quot;
and &quot;distaste&quot; with the expectation that the test taker would learn this on a conscious level through
the course of the test.</p>
