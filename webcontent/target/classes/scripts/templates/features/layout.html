<p>The default size of an IAT is 500 pixels by 500 pixels, but this is modifiable via the layout interface accessible
from the View drop-down menu. You can also resize the elements of the IAT window from within it. The program will do 
its best to automatically position the elements of the test window to fit the sizes you specify. If there is overlap, 
you will see a screen like this:</p>
<div>
    <picture>
        <source srcset="images/layout-screenshot.webp" type="image/webp" />
        <source srcset="images/layout-screenshot.png" type="image/png" />
        <img src="images/layout-screenshot.png" />
    </picture>
</div>
<p>You can also change the color of the IAT border, the interior of the test box, and the exterior web page space.</p>
