    <p>Response keys are the sets of categories stimuli are associated with. Each response key consists of two values, one that appears in the 
        upper-left corner of the test window and one that appears in the upper-right. There are three types of response keys that you will 
        utilize in the design of your IAT, though if you are creating a traditional 7-block IAT, you will only have to deal with one of these types.</p>
    <p><span class="hilight">Simple Response</span> Keys are utilized in blocks one and two of the IAT. These are the blocks in which you present your stimuli to the test-taker 
        to familiarize him or her with them. They are to categorize each stimulus with one of the two response key values.</p>

            <p>Above is a stimulus that the test taker should associate with the response key &quot;Flower.&quot; The test taker will not see the 
                green outline around the correct response. If the flower stimulus appears in block two of the IAT, it will appear again 
                in block five with the response key values in the upper-left transposed with the response key in the upper-right.</p>
            <p>Suppose the picture on the left is an item block two.  Then its response key is a Simple Response Key,  which you must

                Its response key is a <span class="hilight">Reversed Response Key</span>.  It is not necessary more than simple response keys

            <p>In the two pictures above, you see examples of <span class="hilight">Combined Response Keys</span>. These appear in blocks three, four, six, 
                and seven of the IAT.  Suppose the flower comes from a group of images of flowers and insects that the user categorizes as 
                <span class="hilight">Flower</span> or <span class="hilight">Insect</span> as the images appear. Then suppose a second set of 
                stimuli exists which the user categorizes as <span class="hilight">Good</span> or <span class="hilight">Bad</span>. Then these 
                response keys would be used in those four blocks of the IAT to measure bias.  If the test taker associates <span class="hilight">Flower</span>
                with <span class="hilight">Good</span>, he would likely respond correctly to the item on the left faster than to the item on the right.</p>
            <p><span class="hilight">Combined Response Keys</span> can be created by conjoining any two Simple Response Keys or 
                <span class="hilight">Reversed Response Keys</span> with a conjunction, usually “or.”  As with <span class="hilight">Reversed Response Keys</span>,
                it is not necessary to manually create <span class="hilight">Combined Response Keys</span>, though you may.  They are typically

    <p>Simple response keys consist of two values, either text or images. These values appear in the upper-left and upper-right corners of the IAT 
        during administration. Response keys vary from one IAT block another. Each IAT block must be assigned a response key. 
        <span class="hilight">Simple Response Keys</span> are comprised of two values, one that will appear in the upper-left corner of the IAT window 
        and one that will appear in the upper-right corner. These values may be text, or they may be images.</p>

            <p>Text response key values consist of a word or a short phrase. Enter the word of phrase in the blank line beneath the font selection bar, 
                then choose your font, font size, and the color of the response key value. Note that you may use any font that is installed on your 
                machine and it will display correctly to the test taker. However, if you design an IAT on your machine and attempt to open the save file 
                for that design on another machine that does not have that font installed, the default system font will be substituted.</p>

    <p>For most IATs, you will use text response keys, but in some instances an image conveys a more robust meaning to the test taker than a word. 
        For instance, if you were attempting to measure attitudes towards different nations, you might wish to use images of national flags. 
        Images will consume the entirety of the response key area when added to a simple response key but are automatically sized later in the 
        design process when incorporated into a combined response key in such a way as to preserve as much image area as possible.</p>

    <p>Reversed response keys are the reverse of simple response keys, meaning the response key value in the upper-left corner is transposed with 
        the response key value in the upper-right corner. In a traditional 7-Block IAT, it is by reversing one of the response keys and then 
        incorporating that reversed response key into combined keys that you achieve meaningful results. You can generate a reverse of any 
        simple response key. It is not possible to directly generate the reverse of a combined response key as current theory does not 
        indicate a reason to do so, yet it is possible create a combined key that consists of two reversed keys.</p>

    <p>Combined response keys are typically used in blocks 3, 4, 6, and 7 of the IAT. There is no need to create your own combined response keys 
        if you are creating a traditional 7-block IAT. You may simply create the first two blocks of the IAT and then click the generate a 
        seven block IAT from the main form. This process will generate blocks 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as well as creating the response keys for 
        these blocks. In the event you are using your own IAT design, you may create your own combined response keys using this option on the 
        <span class="hilight">Response Key Form</span>.  You may also use this form to modify combined response keys generated by the program.  
        By default, the word “or” is used to conjoin the response keys from blocks one and two in the construction of the combined response keys 
        for the other blocks.  That will obviously remain unchanged in most circumstances, but you might wish to change the color, font, or 
        size of the conjunction.  You may also change the padding above and below the conjunction.  When response keys are generated upon 
        clicking the <span class="hilight">Generate 7-Block IAT Button</span>, their names take the form, &quot;Generated Response Key #1,&quot;
        &quot;Generated Response Key #2,&quot; etc.  Five such keys will be generated, one for each block produced by the process, 
        even though the response keys for blocks three and four will be identical, and likewise with the response keys for blocks six and seven.</p>
    <p>If you use images as the values for a simple response key, then when this is incorporated into a combined response key, 
        these images will be shrunk to accommodate the space available.  This will result in the image in the simple response key 
        being shrunk as well.  This is done to ensure the consistency of what is presented to the test taker.  If you later either 
        delete the combined response keys that simple key is incorporated or remove that simple key from those combined response keys, 
        the images in the simple key will return to their original size.</p>
