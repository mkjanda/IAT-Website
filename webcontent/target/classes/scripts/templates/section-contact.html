<div>
    <p>If you have any questions, inquiries, concerns. If you encounter any bugs. Even if you &quot;just need someone to talk to&quot;
    or need relationship advice. If you want to argue politics and religion. If there's something you'd like help with, I want to try
    to provide that help or explain why I cannot or, in some cases, will not. Please contact me at the address below. Incidentally, my name's Michael.</p>
