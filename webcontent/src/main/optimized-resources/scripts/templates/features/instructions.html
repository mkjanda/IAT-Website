<p>Instruction screens can be set to appear in before or between IAT blocks. There are three sorts of
instruction screens: plain text, text with a response key, and a mock item instruction screen. Screens
are grouped into blocks. A block can contain any number of screens. Note that blocks 3 &amp; 4, which 
utilize the same response key, are transposed with blocks 6 &amp; 7, which also utilize the same response key
on alternate administrations of the test. It is possible to create sets of instruction screens before block 3
and before block 6 that are also transposed with one another on alternate administrations of the test.
Details can be found in the instruction manual that is included in the product download.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the following text appear in one of the instruction screens preceding the first
block of the IAT:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px"><span class="hilight">This is a timed test, so work as quickly as you can while 
making as few mistakes as possible.</span></p>
<p>The plain text instruction screen is, as you can imagine, text with a font and color of your choosing.
Feel free to use any font you have installed on your computer. The test-taker will see the same font as
all text is converted to images before being uploaded to the server. The text &amp; response key instruction
screen is self-explanitory as well. It is wise to include an response key instruction screen before each
block wherein the response key differs from the response key in the previous block.</p>

<p>As you can see, mock item instruction screens are a bit more elaborate. Outlining the correct response is
optional. The text at the very bottom of the preview window is editable as well. In addition to what is shown, 
you may also include the error mark that appears when an item is answered incorrectly.</p>
