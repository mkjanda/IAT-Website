<p>Response keys contain the words, pictures, or symbols that test-takers associate stimuli with. You must
design response keys for blocks 1 &amp; 2 of your IAT. The other response keys are created by the software
when you click the <span class="buttonReference">Generate 7-Block IAT</span> button on the main interface. 
To access the response key interface, choose <span class="buttonReference">Response Keys&</span> from the 
View drop-down menu at the top of the window or click the <span class="buttonReference">Create / Manage Keys</span>
button in any of the three interfaces that utilize response keys such as the IAT block design panel.</p>

<p>Response keys have three types: simple, reversed, and combined. With the possible exception of mock item
instruction screens, you need only create simple response keys. The others will be generated by the software.
You can use text of a color, size, and font of your choice or you can browse for an image file on your computer.
See the manual included in the software download for more details.</p>
