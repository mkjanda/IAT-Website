    <p>The server interface is used to manage the IATs you have on the server. With it, you can upload tests, delete
        tests, and retrieve result data. You can also use it to view usage statistics for each test you have on the
        server
        and your remaining allotted resources. To delete a test or clear the data for a test, select it in the pane on
        the left
        and then enter your password for the test if you chose not to store it in your computer’s registry or are using
        a
        different computer. Next, click either the <span class="hilight">Delete IAT</span> or <span
            class="hilight">Deleted IAT Data</span>
        button. If you supplied the correct password, you should be prompted for confirmation and notified that the
        operation was successful.</p>
    <p>To retrieve your result data, select your test and, again, enter the password if you did not store it to your
        computer’s registry.
        Click the <span class="hilight">Retrieve IAT Results</span> button. The data should download from the server and
        appear
        in the preview pane to the right. Retrieving your IAT data will not delete it from the server.</p>

    <p>Above you see the various ways to preview your results. When the data has been completely downloaded, you
        can then export it to a Microsoft Excel file. This process can be lengthy, taking ten or more minutes on slower
        computers with large result sets, so please be patient. You will be notified when your spreadsheet file is
        ready.
