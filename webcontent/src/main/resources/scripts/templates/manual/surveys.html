    Questionnaire may be designated to appear before or after the IAT and may be
    specified to alternate from before the IAT to after it. This alternation, as
    well as the alternation of IAT elements is discussed elsewhere in
    <span class="hilightHover"
        data-bind="event : { click : () => { navigate('manual', 'manual-alternating-items'); } }">Specifying Alternating
        Items</span>. Surveys are added to the IAT on the main screen and editable through the
    <span class="hilight">Survey Form</span>. A caption may be added to the survey
    by clicking the <span class="hilight">Include Survey Caption</span> checkbox.
    The textual content of a survey caption may be set, and its font size. The
    color of the text, caption background, and the color and width of the border
    appearing at the bottom of the caption may also be set. The font of the survey
    caption cannot be set for the reason that surveys are displayed as HTML pages
    and it cannot be known with any certainty what fonts the end-user will have
    installed on his machine. What enables the font elements within the IAT to be
    set is that all text is stored as image data during the packaging process.

            The survey design form contains a row of buttons on the right for adding
            items. To add an item, click on that items response type and a question of
            that type will be appended to the end of the survey. Alternatively, to
            insert an item be- fore the active question, click the Insert button in
            the top-right before clicking on the response type. The selected item is
            denoted by the green bars on either side of it. More than one item can be
            selected for a Cut/Copy/Paste operation. Questions can be collapsed or
            expanded by clicking the up or down arrows, respectively, in the box that

                These are items that consist of a statement that is answered as true or
                false. The statements need not be &quot;True&quot; and &quot;False&quot;
                but the true statement will always have a response value of 1 and the
                false statement will always have a response value of 0.

                Likert items consist of a statement followed by a list of statements
                that describe the degree to which the test taker either agrees or
                disagrees with the statement, the extent to which the statement applies
                to the test taker, the frequency with which the statement holds true,
                etc. By default, Likert items contain the seven statements shown below.
                These statements can be modified by clicking on the text of the
                statement, they can be removed by clicking on the X button to the right
                of the statement, and more statements can be added by clicking the Add
                Choice button. The response value contained in the data file is
                indicated to the left of each statement. If you wish to reverse-score a
                Likert item, simply click the
                <span class="hilight">Reverse Scored</span> checkbox. This will not
                modify the order of the statements. Instead, the numerical values
                associated with the statements will switch to a declining order so that
                the first response would have a value of seven and the last a value of
                one.

                Weighted multiple choice items are similar to multiple choice items

    It is possible to create questionnaires with time limits by entering a value
    in the &quot;Time Limit&quot; box. These questionnaires will automatically
    submit to the server after the given period of time has expired. All
    unanswered questions will be given a value of &quot;null&quot; in the results
    spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>
    It is also possible to create a questionnaire item that requires a unique
    response from each test-taker. Only certain types of items can be chosen. You
    may supply a list of valid responses, each of which can then be used by only
    once, by one test taker. Optionally, you may omit this list of valid
    responses, which will ensure that each test-taker must supply a unique
    response but places no constraints upon the value of those responses.
</p>
<p>
    You may also denote a questionnaire item as optional simply by clicking the
    <span class="hilight">Optional</span> rectangle that appears when you mouse
    over the item. The rectangle should highlight in blue. Any result sets in
    which that do not include a reply to this question will read “Unanswered” in
    the result spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>
    You may also format the text of your questionnaire items by click the
    <span class="hilight">Format Text</span> rectangle that appears when you mouse
    over the question. The right-hand panel will be swapped out with a text
    formatting panel. You may choose from a small collection of fonts as well as
    font-sizes, font-colors, bold, italic, etc. Click
    <span class="hilight">Done</span> to return to the questionnaire edit screen.
