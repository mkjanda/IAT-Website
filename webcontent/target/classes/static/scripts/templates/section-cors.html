<p>The software was not designed for standalone test administration but if you wish, you may
    keep your own site's domain in the address bar during test administration or host a test within an iframe.
    All IATs are setup for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, which is necessary for the following forward proxy setup
    that will allow you to transparently run a test on your own server.</p>

        <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The configuration to the left tests for matching URI patterns to forward as well as ensuring
        that your server's name is available as a request header . Requests at the URL path /my-iat will be forwarded to 
            <span class="hilight">iatsoftware.net</span> with an IAT name of &quot;MyIAT,&quot; for a client with the ID of 100. Additionally, any
             elements such as tokens in the query string to /my-iat will be preserved.</p>
     <p>Turning so many SSL options to &quot;off&quot; might raise a red flag in your mind. The 
     reason for this is the first line, which ensures that your host name will appear as an HTTP
     request header when it arrives at <span class="hilight">iatsoftware.net</span>. An effect
     of this is that your host will try to perform SSL authentication on itself using the credentials
     at <span class="hilight">iatsoftware.net</span>. It is receiving the same certificate that
     a browser does during a direct connection, so if the test-taker's connection to your server
     is secure, there's no cause for alarm.</p>
     <p>I regret that I simply do not have time to mock up configurations for other popular web hosting
     software, but at the time of this writing, no interest has been shown in this feature. I am
     including it because I feel it is inevitable that I will.</p>
