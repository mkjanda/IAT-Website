<p>To create the IAT, it is not necessary to create all seven blocks. The program is designed to take the two initial
    blocks of the IAT,
    the stimuli and scoring keys you define for them, and generate the remaining five blocks of the IAT. The test
    structure is comprised of blocks and
    surveys. Blocks are either either IAT blocks or blocks of instruction screens. We will begin by creating an IAT
    block.</p>

        <p>The buttons along the left side of the screen allow you to insert various elements into the IAT: surveys,
            blocks
            of IAT items, and blocks of instruction screens. Other buttons allow you to perform tasks such as generating
            a 7-block IAT from two
            manually defined IAT blocks, packaging an IAT for upload, or opening the server interface to upload your IAT
            and download your result data.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>In pane on the right, you will see previews of the various elements of the test as you add them. You will be able to
    click on individual stimuli
    or instruction screens to select them for editing or click on a block header to move it up and down through the test
    to control
    order of administration.</p>
<p>When the program starts for the first time, it will collect a list of all fonts you have installed on your system.
    Then a screen similar to the
    one above will be displayed. You will begin by creating an IAT Block. Click the Add IAT Block button in the
    upper-left then select
    &quot;IAT Block #1&quot; from the contents pane by left-clicking on it. The preview window on the right will display
    an empty IAT block with
    no stimuli. Click the edit button to open the IAT Block panel. Before adding any stimuli to the IAT Block, first
    define the response keys.
    To do this, click the Create/Manage Keys button in the upper right. A new window will appear. Click Create New
    Response Key and then fill out
    the form until until it appears similar the first of the two following images.</p>

        <p>The response key window allows for the creation of three types of keys. There is the simple key which is
            typically only employed in the
            first and second block of the IAT. You may use either text or image values in a response key. Most of the
            time, a text value will suffice
            but if, for instance, you are creating an IAT that measures attitudes towards two different countries, you
            may wish to use the national
            flag of these countries as a response key value. The reversed and combined response keys are used in blocks
            three through seven of the IAT.
            If you are creating a standard 7-block IAT, then you do not have to create these keys yourself. They will be
            generated by the program.</p>

    <p>After filling out the form as shown, click the Create Response button in the lower right and then either close
        the window or click the Previous Form button. Now, on the IAT block design form, click the drop-down list at the
        top and select “key 1.” After that, begin adding stimuli. Do so by clicking the Text option under stimulus type.
        Before entering your first stimulus, select a font, size, and color. The choices you make will be saved and
        applied to subsequent stimuli. You will want eight “good” words and eight “bad” words. You can use the following
        words in the table to the right or choose your own. For each stimulus, select the left or right keyed direction
        as appropriate, keying the “good” words Good and the “bad” words towards Bad.</p>
    <p>After entering your stimuli, enter the instructions that will appear at the bottom of the test window. To do
        this, select a font, font color, and font size at the top of the instruction blank. Then enter the following
        instructions: “Press the E key to associate the word with the category in the upper-left or the I key to
        associate the word with the category in the upper-right.”</p>

    <div class="sidebar">
        <p>The block editing panel is the backbone of the IAT design program, and likely where you'll spend most of your
            time. Here, you'll create
            your stimuli, add a scoring key, and key those stimuli. The small text area in the lowe right allows you to
            add a bit of text to the
            bottom of your test window. The bottom pane allows you to scroll through your stimuli to select one for
            editing, or even to reorder
            them by dragging and dropping . . . in case you want to alphabetize them for to satisfy some personality
            quirk of yours &ndash;
            remember, stimuli are presented in a random order.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Now click the Done button to return to the main form. The app will warn you if you forget to key a stimulus.</p>
<p>Next up, we do it one more time. Create a new IAT block and open it for editing. I'm walking you through creating a
    Flower/Insect IAT, but if you'd
    like to choose something else, that's easy enough. Click the Create/Manage Keys button and create a response key
    with either the words &quot;Flower&quot;
    and &quot;Insect&quot; or the word or images of your own. For instance, you could do something meaningful like
    measure national loyalty among Chinese immigrants
    by using the flag response key above. Alternatively, you could create the following response key:</p>
<div style="text-align: left; width: 789px; margin-left: 10%; max-width: 90%;">

</div>
<p>If you're doing Flower/Insect, click <a href="http://www.iatsoftware.net/Materials/Materials.zip">here</a> to
    download images for your IAT.
    If you're creating a Tentacle/Scheiße IAT, you're on your own. Key the images as you add them, add instructions as
    before: &quot;Press the E
    key if the image is of a Flower or the I key if it of an Insect.&quot; Hit Done when finished. I'd save at this
    point if I were you.
    At the time of this writing, I haven't had a report of a crash or freeze in six months, but updates are issued and
    bugs sometimes enter
    the software with the new features.</p>
<p>Now, click Generate 7-Block IAT. You should see blocks 3-7 spit out by the program. For those who enjoy their
    instructions belabored:</p>
<div class="imageOverText">

        <img src="images/manual/main-form-flower-insect-7block.png" />
    </picture>
    <div class="sidebar">
        <p>The header elements in the contents pane represent blocks of items in your tests or surveys. You can click on
            one of these to
            expand it to display either the stimuli or the instruction screens contained in that block. The color coding
            denotes which of
            these blocks of items are to be transposed on alternate administrations. By default, blocks 3 and 4 are
            transposed with blocks
            6 and 7 on alternate administrations.</p>
        <p>To modify an item, click the edit button in the right-hand pane. You can also delete a block of items or move
            it up or down in
            the contents list with the buttons of those names.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>As of yet, there are no instructions for blocks 3 through 7. Generating the 7-block IAT created the necessary scoring
    keys and placed the
    appropriate items in each block and keyed them, but it didn't generate instructions for those blocks. You should
    create some by clicking
    on each block and then clicking the Edit button. Use the following instructions, if you'd like:</p>
<div id="blockInstructions">
    <div class="left">
        <p>Blocks #3 and #4</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
        <p>Press the E key to associate the word or image with the category in the upper-left or the I key to associate
            it with
            category in the upper-right.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <p>Block #5</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
        <p>Press the E key to associate the image with the category in the upper-left or the I key to associate it with
            category
            in the upper-right.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <p>Block #6 and #7</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
        <p>Press the E key to associate the word or image with the category in the upper-left or the I key to associate
            it with
            category in the upper-right.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Next, it’s necessary to add instruction screens to your IAT. Click the Add Instruction Block button on the left and
    select the Instruction Block #1 Header at the bottom of the contents list. Click the Move Up button until the item
    is at the top of the contents list. Then click the edit button in the right hand pane. First, it might be best to
    add an instruction screen that consists solely of text to introduce the test-taker to the IAT he or she is about to
    take. Select “Text” next to Instruction Screen type and choose your font, font size, and font color. Then enter the
    instructions shown below:</p>
<div class="inlineImgDiv">
    <div class="sidebar">
        <p>This will be the first thing your test-taker sees when the IAT begins. It's a good idea to have a few screens
            of instructions at the start of the test. Don't give away the mechanics of how the test is scored, but let
            your test-taker know that it's expected that he will make mistakes and that it's as important to move
            quickly through the items as it is to provide correct answers.</p>

        </picture>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar">
        <p>The mock item is the most elaborate type of instruction screens. You choose a scoring key and define a
            stimulus. If you’d like,
            you can define a new response key just for the mock item by clicking the Create / Manage Keys button. For
            more information,
            <span class="hilightHover"
                data-bind="event : { click : () => { navigate('manual', 'manual-response-keys'); } }">click here</span>.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Click the Add Screen button again to create a final instruction screen for this block. Denote the type as Text &
    Response Key. Select
    &quot;key 1&quot; from the drop-down list of response keys the select your font, font size, and font color before
    entering the following
    text: &quot;For the first portion of the test, you will be shown words that can be categorized as either good or
    bad. Press the E key
    to categorize the word as Good or the I key to categorize the word as Bad.&quot;</p>
<p>Now create instruction screens for the remainder of the test. Add instruction blocks before IAT blocks 2, 3, 5, and 6
    similar to the last
    instruction screen for block one. For the instruction screen that appears before block 2, use key 2. For the screen
    before block 3, use
    Generated Key 1. For the screen before block 5, use generated key 3, and use Generated key 4 for the screen before
    block 6.</p>
<p>Now that you have created your instruction blocks, you need to specify that instruction block #3 will alternate with
    instruction block #5
    on alternate administrations so they appear before the correct IAT blocks. To do this, click the Specify Alternating
    Items button.
    The interface below will appear. Select Instruction Block #3 and Instruction Block #5 from the list and then click
    the Alternate
    Items button. Click OK to return to the main form.</p>

            and instruction blocks can only be selected to swap out or be transposed on alternate administrations while
            any number of surveys
            can be selected. If one survey is selected and set to alternate, it will alternate between appearing before
            and after the IAT.
            If more than two surveys are selected, they will rotate. IAT elements will alternate before survey elements.
            For example, if
            you have blocks that alternate in your IAT and one survey that is set to alternate, then the IAT elements

<p>The last thing you will add to your IAT is a questionnaire. Click the Add Pre-IAT Survey button to insert a blank
    questionnaire before
    the IAT then highlight it by left clicking upon it in the contents pane. Click the edit button in the preview pane
    to define items for it.
    The first thing you might want to do is to add a caption to the survey. Click the Include Survey Caption checkbox in
    the panel on the right
    side and then enter &quot;Questionnaire of Attitudes&quot; at the top of the screen. If you desire, you can select a
    font-size or color scheme for
    the caption other than the default. Before adding questions to your survey, add a brief set of instructions. To do
    this, click the
    Instructions button on the right and an instruction blank will appear in the survey panel. Click in it and type,
    &quot;Please answer each
    of the following questions honestly. All responses are anonymous.&quot; Now begin adding items to your survey.
    First, add a question to
    request the test-taker’s gender. Click Multiple Choice on the right panel and in the blank that appears, type
    &quot;I am:&quot;
    Then click the Add Choice button below and to the right of this blank and add choices for &quot;Female&quot; and
